# Oculus Service Manager ( OSM )
Its just batch script that basically runs Windows shell commands.
Made for pure convinience, and accessibility for normies!

## Install Guide
So its simple
Download it, then run the script.

But thats cluttery, nobody wants to seek a batch file just to play VR.
So my recommendation would be to put it in your `path` directory.

## Ok, so how do i make a path directory?
 Its actually simple to make one!
 To make one do the following.

1. Make a folder somewhere on your computer, for example `C:\Path\` **Remember that path!**
2. Open the start menu.
3. Type `environment variables`
4. Open the first thing.

7. Once in the Environment Variables submenu, look for `Path` under the `System variables` then press `Edit`

8. Then Press `New` and type the path of the folder you've created earlier, then press `Enter` then press `OK`

## Tada! you've a path folder!
So you might be asking `okay so? what is it for?` its an universal access folder, meaning you can access from anywhere you want, despite in what directory you are in. pretty neat huh?

So go ahead and put `osm.bat` in your Path folder and try it now!
The quickest way to open something in your Path folder is from the `Run` window.
So to do it, you press `Win` + `R` to open the `Run` window

Go ahead and type `osm` then press `Enter` to fire up OSM.
